- 👋 Hi, I’m Luke and I write software that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change

- 🎓 I’m studying at Makers Academy bootcamp

- 🌱 I currently use [Ruby](https://github.com/lukestorey95?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=ruby&sort=) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/lukestorey95?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=javascript&sort=), but I love to learn new things!

- 💞️ I'm an advocate for pair programming and am open to collaborating on interesting projects

- 👀 I'm actively looking for Software Engineering jobs and you can find me on on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukemstorey)
